# TwoPaneShell

This is TwoPaneShell, the UWP shell application used to host two-pane samples from Windows Developer Incubation and Learning (DIaL) for dual-screen Windows devices.  TwoPaneShell consists of a MainPage hosting a [TwoPaneView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.twopaneview?view=winui-2.3) control and two Panes, which are placeholders for your own sample controls and content.
